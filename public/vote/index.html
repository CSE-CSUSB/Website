                <p>Friends of the Computer Science & Engineering Club,</p>
                <p>In the last year we have seen overwhelming growth within the club. What was once a handful of individuals is now a community of more than seventy members joined together by our common interests. Our library has grown to include scores of books, we've funded an exciting and ongoing quadrotor project, and just this quarter we have tutored dozens of students. We've made real progress, but we've got more work to do.</p>
                <p>As many of you may have noticed, our meetings and events have seen declining attendence. We've struggled to handle changes within officership throughout the year. Events have been canceled and promises have been left unfulfilled. Finally, we are not currently fully ACM compliant. This is unacceptable, and we must strive to do better to create the club that the students of CSUSB deserve.</p>
                <p>Over the past year, I have held the positions of Webmaster and Treasurer. In these positions, I have done my best to act as an objective member of the board who seeks to make sure nothing goes awry. While this attitude has been instrumental in assuring that the club stay within certain bounds, it's time for me to step up.</p>
                <p>I intend to fix these problems that I've outlined. I have a detailed plan for achieving this, and I will work to the best of my ability to ensure that the club reaches it's full potential. Please contact me if you have any questions.</p>

                <p>If you elect me as one of these officers, I will strive to ensure that we embrace more knowledge in the field of computer science and engineering. This club should become stronger academically and serve as a beacon to those who wish to succeed. Our members should be highly involved and motivated more about computer science and engineering than any other students in the department. The problem I see
            with our department is that a lot of students are not motivated by the subject. People come to class, do their work, and then go home. I rarely see students stick around after class and talk about computer science or computer engineering. I rarely see students engage in feedback during the lectures and a lot of them struggle during the labs. As a club we need to boost the spirit of the department and get people interested in pursuing and sharing knowledge in this field. The CSE club needs to be more than a social club, it needs to be a source of academic inspiration and prosperity.</p>
                <p>By running for these roles, I also strive to ensure fairness and non-partisan policies made for the club by me and the other officers. I will make sure to scrutinize every decision brought up amongst the officers and make sure that it is constitutional and sound. I do not want to see a mindless agreement between the officers just because they are friends. I want to see progress through everyone's participation and diversity of ideas. </p>

                <p>CSE Club is doing well. In the last year we've watched our membership, our finances, and our offerings increase greatly, and we are now presented with an opportunity to seriously improve the lives of our members.</p>
                  <p>Several quarters ago I started a peer-to-peer volunteer tutoring program, first just me, and then with only two tutors. We know have six tutors, covering a great majority of the classes offered by this department, and students are noticing. Attendance at tutoring hours and office hours has exploded. My first goal for the next year is to expand and improve tutoring, including getting more tutors, providing better advertising, and making resources available online for a number of department courses.</p>
                  <p>I also want to start a club workshop program, where students can come at regular times to learn important and useful skills they may not get in class.</p>
                  <p>I'll also work to expand and improve the projects program, making projects more visible, and more consistent.</p>
                  <p>Finally, I'll work with the Webmaster to make more resources available online, including club forms, lightning talk videos, and detailed project information.</p>
                  <p>My goals for next year are to build on the good things we're already doing. To make the club more visible, and to provide more resources to students in the School of Computer Science and Engineering. If elected for next year, I will work as hard as I can to continue the club's success, and to make life better for you.</p>

                <p>Even though I've attended most of the CSE-Club's meetings and some of the language workshops, I feel that I have not contributed enough to the club. Since it is my first year at CSUSB, I have the opportunity to gain years of experience and insight as a club member, and if elected, also as its treasurer. Next year, most of my courses will deal with the computer engineering major, so I will be more competent and motivated to be a part of the club and its projects.</p>
                <p>I especially wish to gain experiences for the purpose of taking initiative in the club.</p>

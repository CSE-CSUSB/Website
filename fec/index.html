                <p>The CubeSat Radiometer Radio Frequency Interference Technology (CubeRRT) Validation Mission:
                First Ever Space-borne Demonstration of Real-Time Interference Filtering</p>
                <br><h3>Abstract:</h3>
                <p>
The CubeSat Radio Frequency Interference Technology (CubeRRT) Validation mission is the first ever technology mission launched to demonstrate the ability to filter radio frequency interference (RFI) in real-time over wide-bandwidths. CubeRRT mission has enabled the path for future science returns with wider bandwidth in an ever shrinking observation spectrum. The mission was launched in June 13, 2018 and has since successfully demonstrated and validated the technology readiness level of digital backend algorithms and technology.
<br><br>
Earth observation remote sensing systems have an extremely limited spectrum allocations. Most of these allocations are shared with several commercial and communication applications, with nearly 90% of the bandwidth between 6 to 40 GHz for non-Earth exploration use. Over the past couple of decades the need for commercial spectrum has been increasing steadily. The ever increasing spectrum has been introducing radio frequency interference (RFI) in passive microwave observations. This has resulted in increased noise and bias in geophysical science retrievals. Though once completely corrupted, microwave measurements cannot be recovered, it is possible to filter out RFI signals and salvage any remaining clean signals using advanced statistical techniques. The SMAP mission successfully demonstrated this on a space-borne mission with ground processing. The algorithm is harder to implement at higher measurement bandwidths than SMAP and would result in extremely high data downlink rates. The CubeSat Radio Frequency Interference Technology (CubeRRT) validation mission was recently launched to demonstrate the ability to filter out RFI signals and retrieve clean science signals from passive microwave radiometry on-board the space craft. The CubeRRT mission was designed to ingest 1 GHz of radiometric measurement bandwidths at microwave frequencies from 6 to 40 GHz. CubeRRT in its first 30 minutes, sucessfully demonstrated on-board RFI filtering using complex on-board algorithms and enabling lowered downlink data rates. CubeRRT has also increased the technology readiness level of the digital backend algorithms and FPGA technology by collecting several hundreds of hours of data without a reset. The CubeRRT mission was led by the Ohio State University with JPL, NASA Goddard, and Blue Canyon Technologies as partners.</p>

                <p>History and Future of Radar and EW</p>
                <br><h3>Abstract:</h3>
                <p>
Aerospace Electronic Systems, and in particular Radar and Electronic Warfare (EW), are one of the most active yet unappreciated fields in the Electrical Engineering community. The IEEE AESS members account for only 1% of the IEEE total, yet the AES market is estimated to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars. Radar and EW applications are typically unheard by the general public, yet they are the backbone of any military force worldwide, providing defense, security, and peace. The history of radar and EW is also intriguing: Robert Buderi considered radar as “the invention that changed the world,” while General Patterson though that radars were the real reason why the Allied forces defeated the Axis powers. This talk will introduce you to the captivating history of radar/EW, leading to the most recent radar/EW systems worldwide and their applications, both civilian and military ones. The talk will show you what radars can do for the society and what the AES industry is looking for, in particular from young engineers. The talk will end with an overview of the IEEE AESS, its benefits to the members, and in particular to students and young professionals.</p>

                <p>Planning for Large-Scale Multi-Robot Systems</p>
                <br><h3>Abstract:</h3>
                <p>
Multi-robot systems are now being used in industry. For example, hundreds of robots navigate autonomously in Amazon fulfillment centers to move inventory pods all the way from their storage locations to the inventory stations that need the products they store (and vice versa). Autonomous aircraft towing vehicles will soon tow aircraft all the way from the runways to their gates (and vice versa), thereby reducing pollution, energy consumption, congestion, and human workload. Path planning for these robots is difficult, yet one must find high-quality collision-free paths for them in real-time. Shorter paths result in higher throughput or lower operating costs (since fewer robots are required). I will discuss different versions of such multi-robot path-planning problems, algorithms for solving them, and their applications. I will also discuss a planning architecture that combines ideas from artificial intelligence and robotics. It makes use of a simple temporal network to post-process the output of a multi-robot path-planning algorithm in polynomial time to create a plan-execution schedule for robots that provides a guaranteed safety distance between them and exploits slack to absorb imperfect plan executions and avoid time-intensive re-planning in many cases.

        <p>Sven Koenig is a professor in computer science at the University of Southern California. Most of his research centers around techniques for decision making (planning and learning) that enable single situated agents (such as robots or decision-support systems) and teams of agents to act intelligently in their environments and exhibit goal-directed behavior in real-time, even if they have only incomplete knowledge of their environment, imperfect abilities to manipulate it, limited or noisy perception or insufficient reasoning speed.
